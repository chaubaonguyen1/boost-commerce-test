Hi Mr. X

As I received your questions about the Auto-Suggestion feature, here is my some of my solutions, hopefully It will be helpful for you.

1. First, you have to come to the App.tsx file, at the line 9, there is an array named "order", If you want to change the order for whatever you want, just change the position of them, like If you want to change the "product" to be the first block, then you just need to move the "product" element to be first element of the array.
2. Just import the "SuggestionFilter" component to the position, pages you want.
3. Just change the property "minSearchLetter" to the number character you want
4. You can override the class "product-wrap, product-img, product-content, product-brand, product-title, product-price" to customize layout of product items in result popup.

If you have further question, please reach me.

Thanks!

Dennis
